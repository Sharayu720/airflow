# Apache Airflow Setup on EC2

This repository contains the setup for **Apache Airflow 2.10.1** deployed on an EC2 instance. The setup includes:

- Airflow configuration and setup
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to deploy to EC2
- Example DAGs to test the setup

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up an EC2 instance with the necessary dependencies (Python, Airflow, etc.).
3. Set up **GitHub Actions** to deploy changes to EC2.
4. Create your own DAGs in the `dags/` folder.

## Files:

- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies for Airflow.
- `entrypoint.sh`: Script to set up and start Airflow on EC2.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for deployment.
- `dags/`: Folder to store your Airflow DAGs.

## Deployment

When you push changes to the `airflow-setup` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically deploy the updates to the EC2 instance.
